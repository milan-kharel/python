python comments is given by:# for single line
docstring is done by quoting data inside triple codes:"""data"""

variable is somewhere you store your data
example:x=100
   y=200
  print(x*y)
  print(x-y)

datatype in python: numbers,string,list,dictionary,tuple,set
number consist of: integer just no i.e 10
                    float consist of decimal value i.e 10.94
                     complex consist 25j where j is imaginary no
                     boolean for true false or equal statement
sting is written inside single quote or double quote where we can operate diffrent methods like finding length,know positionn of letter
list is an array which is changeable and ordered have index like string
dictionaries is like list but unorderd changeable and indexed has got key value datatype
tuple is ordered and unchangeable
set is collection n does not contain duplicate as in tuple

Type conversion  when convert variable in another datatype
int(), float(), tuple(), list(), set(), dict()

there are four types of collection data types in python which are used to store collection of data where different task can be done.
they are: lists, tuples, sets, dictionary

specialised collections data types they are: namedtuple(), chainmap, deque, counter, ordereddict, defaultdict, userdict, userdict, userlist, user docstring
to have collection u need to call it first: from collectiion import namedtuple

array is basically a data structure which can hold more than one value at  a time. it is collection or ordered series of elements of the same types.
array can store only one type of data type but list can store all type of datatype inside it
different thing that can be doe in array are: find length of array, adding/changing element in array, removing/deleting elements of array, array concatenation, slicing and looping through an array

Hash Table or Hashmap
it is type of data structure that maps keys to its value pairs
key-value pairs system to easily accesed of data
can operate operation like: accessing iteams, updating values, deleting enteries
convert dictionaries into a dataframe neeto import panda

Operators in python: arithematic, assignment,comparision,logical,membership,identify,bitwise

Loops in python: while, for and nested
